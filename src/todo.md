## To do

#### General improvements

- Longevity should be an evolutionary trait, not a setting. âœ“
- Reciprocity in SharingSimulator.
- Define specific settings for different simulators. e.g.: for ShareOrTake, always false starvation and false static
food gen.
  
- Automatic statistic data recollection.
- Compared simulations!

####Simulators
  
- Combination of ShareWithStarving and ShareOrTake.
- Depletion simulation with size/energy waste correlation.
- Depletion simulation with ShareWithStarving.
- Prey/predator.

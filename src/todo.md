## To do

#### General improvements

- Longevity should be an evolutionary trait, not a setting. âœ“
- Reciprocity in SharingSimulator.
- Define specific settings for different simulators. e.g.: for ShareOrTake, always false starvation and false static
food gen.
  
- Automatic statistic data recollection.
- Compared simulations!

####Simulators
  
- Share or take simulation with "free choice". Altruism not a bool, but an inclination (float probability).
  Punishment for selfish organisms should exist. All would come to the evaluation of how costly it is to share
  and how costly it is not to.
- Combination of ShareWithStarving and ShareOrTake.
- Depletion simulation with size/energy waste correlation.
- Depletion simulation with ShareWithStarving.
- Prey/predator.
